## What is Airflow ? 

A pipeline orchestration in python ecosystem.
Building a Machine Leaning Pipeline.

Its tool for authoring, scheduling, and monitoring pipelines. As a result, is an ideal solution for ETL and MLOps use cases.


## Use Case 

1. Read an image dataset from a cloud-based storage

2. Process the images

3. Train a deep learning model with the downloaded images

4. Upload the trained model in the cloud

5. Deploy the model

More Example like ;

- Extracting data from many sources, aggregating them, transforming them, and store in a data warehouse.

- Extract insights from data and display them in an analytics dashboard

- Train, validate, and deploy machine learning models

## Key Stuff

- Webserver : Webserver is Airflowâ€™s user interface (UI), which allows you to interact with it without the need for a CLI or an API. From there one can execute, and monitor pipelines, create connections with external systems, inspect their datasets, and many more.

- Executor : Executor: Executors are the mechanism by which pipelines run. There are many different types that run pipelines locally, in a single machine, or in a distributed fashion. A few examples are `LocalExecutor, SequentialExecutor, CeleryExecutor and KubernetesExecutor`

- Scheduler : The scheduler is responsible for executing different tasks at the correct time, re-running pipelines, backfilling data, ensuring tasks completion, etc.

- PostgreSQL : A database where all pipeline metadata is stored. This is typically a Postgres but other SQL databases are supported too.

Easy if you use `Docker Compose`
